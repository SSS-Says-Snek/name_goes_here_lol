## Guidelines for contributing

Lol, just contribute. Make a pull request or some issues, I'm pretty lonely right now.

## How to contribute
To contribute, submit a pull request at [https://github.com/SSS-Says-Snek/name_goes_here_lol/pulls](https://github.com/SSS-Says-Snek/name_goes_here_lol/pulls).
Major changes such as implementing a new currency in the shop would be reviewed by me,
while small changes like balancing items and buffs will... still be reviewed by me.
When contributing, there are certain rules to follow, listed down below

## Requirements for contributing
- [X] Contributions must solve a problem and/or fix a bug
- [X] Contributors are expected to follow the project's Code of Conduct

## Your guide to contributing to name_goes_here_lol

There are a few things to know before you start contributing to the game
1. First of all, contributors are advised and expected to follow PEP 8, to create clean code. If you do not comply to PEP 8, 
  there is less of a chance that your PR would not be merged
2. It is strongly advised for contributors to add comments and docstrings to their code. However, if they do not add comments/docstrings, 
  it doesn't really matter, as long as their code is somewhat readable
3. There are a couple misleading function names in the project. For example, `handle_events()` actually only handles one event.
  Be careful with the function names!
4. Try to avoid files that are larger than 3,000 lines of code, as the code starts to get less readable. ***HOWEVER***, the main 
  exception to this rule is `state.py`, as it would cause a circular import if the file is split

That's it for now lol
