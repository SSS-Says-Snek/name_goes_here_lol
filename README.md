Title's kinda misleading, it's just Snake+ (upgraded version of snake, I had nothing to do, ok?)

Right now, Snake+ should just be an upgraded version of snake, with progress, **ENEMIES**, and fun. Not good at working with classes, so if you look at my code it's gonna look like trash... Not that my code without classes is good, kek. This is also my first time making a semi-original idea in pygame, so some ideas will suck.

Only menu's functioning rn lol
