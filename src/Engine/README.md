## src/Engine subdirectory

This subdir contains all code __that mainly makes the game work__. A quick guide to all files and subdirs here:

- Entities **(SUBDIR)**: This subdir contains all classes related to entities used in the playing game state (E.g enemies, players)
- States **(SUBDIR)**: This (very IMPORTANT) subdir contains all classes related to the state machine the game uses (E.g Settings, Playing Game State)
- README.md **(FILE/TEXT)**: This file... is the thing you're looking at rn :kekw:
- animate.py **(FILE/SCRIPT)**: This file **SHOULD** contain animations for specific things, but there is nothing there yet :kekw:
- base.py **(FILE/SCRIPT)**: This file contains base things (E.g Base State, Base Entity)
- button.py **(FILE/SCRIPT)**: This file contains all classes that are related to buttons (Image Buttons, Rectangle Buttons)
- game.py **(FILE/SCRIPT)**: This file contains the class used to actually run the game in main.py
- objects.py **(FILE/SCRIPT)**: This file contains miscellaneous classes that are used throughout the game

That's a quick overview of what's inside the src/Engine subdirectory, of course, there are more subdirs in the subdirs :kekw:
